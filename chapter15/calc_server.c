  Title          : spl_calc_server.c
  Author         : Stewart Weiss
  Created on     : May 16, 2024
  Description    : Server that evaluates bc arithmetic expressions
  Purpose        : To introduce iterative server and client design
  Usage          : spl_calcd &
  Build with     : gcc -Wall -I../include -L../lib -g -o spl_calcd \
                          spl_calc_server.c -lspl

  Usage          : Start this server first using the command
                   spl_calcd &
                   Then start up any client as a foreground process.
                   Expressions sent by the client will be evaluated and
                   sent back to the client.

  Comments       : This server handles all user-initiated terminating signals
                   by closing any descriptors that it has open and removing
                   the public FIFO and exiting. If it gets a SIGPIPE because
                   a client closed its read end of its private FIFO
                   immediately after sending a message but before the server
                   wrote back the converted string, it handles SIGPIPE by
                   continuing to listen for new messages and giving up on the
                   write to that pipe.
