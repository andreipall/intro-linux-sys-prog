This repository contains source code for the programs in the book
"Introduction to System Programming in Linux"  written by Stewart Weiss.  
The book  will be published by No Starch Press;
it can be purchased at:
https://nostarch.com/introduction-system-programming-linux
Through the Early Access program, you can get e-copies of completed
chapters.

For instructions on building the programs, see the file BUILDING.

For notes on changes that have been made to the code since it was
published in the book, see the file CHANGES.

Source Code Licensing

All complete programs provided in this repository are covered by
the GNU General Public License (Version 3), a copy of which is
contained in the file COPYING.gplv3 in this directory.  
The source code for all library functions (in the common/ and include/ 
directories) is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License (Version 3), a copy of
which is in the file COPYING.lgplv3 in this directory.

Organization of Subdirectories
The subdirectories are either named by chapter, in the form ChapterNN,
or have names such as "include", "lib", "makefiles", and so forth.
The ChapterNN directories contain code introduced in the corresponding 
chapter of the book.
The other chapters are self-explanatory.


Building Executables and Libraries
Each chapter is a self-contained collection of programs with its own 
separate README  file.  You should read that file before doing anything 
in that chapter.

All program code depends on the files in the  common  directory. To build
the programs in any chapter, you must set up your environment as follows:

1. After cloning the repository,  cd  into the common directory and run  make :

      $ cd common
      $ make
      

2. Then run  make install  in that directory:

      $ make install
      
   This copies the header file created by  make  into the  include  directory 
   in this repository, and the static library  libspl.a  into the  lib 
   directory.

3. Now  cd  into the directory you'd like to build and run  make  there, e.g.

     $ cd ../chapter05
     $ make
