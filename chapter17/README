This directory contains demo programs for Chapter 17, which explores methods 
of I/O other than blocking reads and writes.  It covers non-blocking terminal 
I/O, signal-driven I/O, POSIX asynchronous I/O, and multiplexed I/O.  Some of 
the programs aren't included in the book; those that aren't in the book are 
marked with *.

The order in which they should be studied is as follows.

nonblock_demo1.c
nonblock_demo2.c
sigio_counter.c
sigio_demo.c
* aio_write_demo.c
cp_aio.c
select_demo.c
