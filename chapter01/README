To compile all programs in this directory, enter
$ make -k
The -k is needed because the program bad_getenv_demo.c will not compile and
the -k option tells make to continue making the other target executables.

bad_getenv_demo.c is included in this directory because negative examples
are just as useful as positive ones. It illustrates a common mistake that
beginning C programmers make.

stdin_demo.c is an older program that showed the use of stdin and stdout.

The programs in this directory are introduced in Chapter 01 in the following
order. Programs marked with a * are not in the book or mentioned by it.

hello.c
* stdin_demo.c
getenv_demo.c
* bad_getenv_demo.c
hello_world.c
getpid_demo.c
gettid_demo.c
