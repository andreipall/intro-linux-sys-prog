To compile all programs in this directory, enter
$ make -k
The -k is needed because the program bad_getenv_demo.c will not compile and
the -k option tells make to continue making the other target executables.

badgetenv.c is included in this directory because negative examples
are just as useful as positive ones. It illustrates a common mistake that
beginning C programmers make.
